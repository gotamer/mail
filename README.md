gotamer/mail
============

Now gotamer/mail also implements the io.Writer interface.
 
```go
	package main

	import (
	    "fmt"
	    
	    "bitbucket.org/gotamer/mail"
	)

	func main() {
		s := new(mail.Smtp)
		s.SetHostname("smtp.gmail.com")
		s.SetHostport(587)
		s.SetFromName("GoTamer")
		s.SetFromAddr("xxxx@gmail.com")
		s.SetPassword("*********")
		s.SetToAddrs("one@example.com", "two@example.com")
		s.AddToAddr("three@example.com")
		s.SetSubject("GoTamer test smtp mail")
		s.SetBody("The Writer below should replace this default line")
		if _, err := fmt.Fprintf(s, "Hello, smtp mail writer\n"); err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
		}
	}
```

#### A note on the host:  
Go SMTP does not allow to connect to SMPT servers with a self signed certs, you will get an error like following:

	x509: certificate signed by unknown authority

The way I got around that is by using [CAcert][1]. [CAcert][1] provides FREE digital certificates.
